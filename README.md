# TrigFourier-Pytorch

Small class implemented in pytorch to compute fourier series in trigonometric (sine-cosine) form. I use it often in my PhD, so I thought it would be nice to share. Should be compatible with Autograd.


### Contents:

  * TrigFourier.py  - Contains the main class.
  * Example.ipynb - Notebook with a basic use example.
